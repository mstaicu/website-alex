## Introduction

This is a client-side application powered by React

## Prerequisites

The following tools need to be installed before you can develop or deploy against this application:

* [github account](https://github.com/join)
* terminal emulator (pick one)
  * [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
  * [Cmder](https://cmder.net/)
  * [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7)
  * cmd
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

## Clone

In order to start contributing to this project or even run it locally, you must first retrieve a copy of the project from Github. In order to do this, we will open the installed terminal emulator and navigate to a folder where we will download the sources.

First, change the volume (partition):

```bash
$ d:
```

Navigation in the terminal is done with the 'change directory' or 'cd' command:

```bash
$ cd D:\Projects
```

Note that you must specify the absolute path, on the volume (partition), to an existing directory

After we have navigated to the desired folder, we can clone the project repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mstaicu/website-alex.git
```

This will download a copy of the repository in your current folder (where you 'changed directory')

## Dependencies

You must install the application dependencies in order to run this application on your local machine.

```bash
$ npm install
```
