## Introduction

This is a client-side application powered by React

## Prerequisites

The following tools need to be installed before you can develop or deploy against this application:

* [github account](https://github.com/join)
* terminal emulator (pick one)
  * [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
  * [Cmder](https://cmder.net/)
  * [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7)
  * cmd
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

## Clone

In order to start contributing to this project or even run it locally, you must first retrieve a copy of the project from Github. In order to do this, we will open the installed terminal emulator and navigate to a folder where we will download the sources

First, change the volume (partition)

```bash
$ d:
```

Navigation in the terminal is done with the 'change directory' or 'cd' command

```bash
$ cd D:\Projects
```

Note that you must specify the absolute path, on the volume (partition), to an existing directory

After we have navigated to the desired folder, we can clone the project repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mstaicu/website-alex.git
```

This will download a copy of the repository in your current folder (where you 'changed directory')

## Dependencies

You must install the application dependencies in order to run this application on your local machine. The installation of the dependencies is done using the following command, issued from the terminal emulator at the root of the project (`npm` is a program that comes with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and is available as a global variable in your terminal emulator after the installation of nodejs)

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Continuous deployment

We are using Travis CI for continous delivery and deployment to production. The deployment pipeline:

* Contributions to this project should be done through Github pull requests. For every opened pull request, a new job is started on Travis CI, which:
  * validates the project
  * builds the project
* A maintainer of the project must approve the pull request, based on the build status from Travis CI
* Once the pull request is merged in the master branch of the repository, Travis CI will start another job, which:
  * validates the project
  * builds the project
  * deploys the project to AWS S3
  * invalidates the Cloudfront distribution

The projects' status page can be found [here](https://travis-ci.org/github/mstaicu/website-alex)
